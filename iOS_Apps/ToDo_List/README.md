# ToDo List
Because of storage use I have decided to include here only the two important elements to show my knowledge: `App.js` and `Component/`;
this because the whole project has a size of 200MB. The other folder required is `node-modules` but this can be downloaded with the
commands below.

## Installation
`sudo npm install --global expo-cli`

`expo init [project_name]`

## Run
`cd [project name]`

`expo start`
